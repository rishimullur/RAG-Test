# RAG-Test

How to Use This Notebook
Setting Up Environment: Before running any code cells, make sure to set up the environment by installing necessary dependencies and importing required libraries.
Introduction to RAG: We will start by introducing the concept of RAG and its applications in NLP tasks. You will learn how to use RAG for text generation and how it combines retrieval and generation models.
Semantic Search with TikToken: Next, we will explore semantic search using TikToken. You will understand how to build a semantic search engine to retrieve relevant documents based on the meaning of the query.
Tokenization with TikToken: Finally, we will dive into tokenization using TikToken. You will learn different tokenization techniques and how to tokenize text data for further processing in NLP tasks.

Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of Python programming language.
Familiarity with concepts in natural language processing (NLP) is helpful but not required.
Google Colab account for running the notebook in the cloud environment.
Resources
TikToken Documentation: Official documentation for TikToken library.
OpenAI GPT: Information about OpenAI's Generative Pre-trained Transformer models.
Semantic Search Explained: Article on semantic search and its applications.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a model architecture that combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches in natural language processing tasks. It leverages pre-trained language models and external knowledge sources to improve text generation. RAG models have been successfully applied in various tasks such as question answering, text summarization, and dialogue systems.

What is Semantic Search?
Semantic search is the process of retrieving information from a large collection of text documents based on the meaning of the query rather than just matching keywords. It aims to understand the intent behind the query and retrieve relevant documents that match the user's needs.

What is Tokenization?
Tokenization is the process of breaking down a text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can be words, subwords, or characters, depending on the tokenization technique used. Tokenization is a fundamental step in many NLP tasks as it enables machines to understand and process natural language text.
